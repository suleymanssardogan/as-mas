# AS-MAS
AI-Driven Autonomous Orbital Multi-Agent System

AS-MAS is a cloud-native, AI-driven autonomous multi-agent system designed to monitor satellite orbits,
perform physics-based propagation, and detect anomalous orbital behavior.

This repository contains the core engine of AS-MAS, focusing on:
- Physics-first orbital modeling
- Modular agent-based architecture
- Production-ready AI lifecycle (training, inference, monitoring)

Current status: Sprint 0 – Foundation & Architecture Decisions
